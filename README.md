# ops-tools
Miscellaneous helper and similar snippets - Bash, Ruby, any useful language where verbose primitives get in the way. 
Code is intended as help/guide, and probably depemds on environment packages and variables.
So could any contributor including myself include necessary information do the files loaded here can be 
   modified/tested/reused with least effort.
Adding hyperlinks to pages that describe prerequisites is a plus.
